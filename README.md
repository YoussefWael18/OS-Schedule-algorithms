# Operating System Scheduling Algorithms
**Status**: In Progress  
This project implements FCFS and SJF scheduling algorithms, reading process data (e.g., arrival time, burst time) from a CSV file. Currently working on process parsing and FCFS logic.  

## Features (Planned)
- Parse process data from a CSV file
- Implement FCFS and SJF scheduling
- Calculate metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time
- Simulate scheduling with numerical analysis (e.g., interpolation for runtime prediction)

## Next Steps
- Complete CSV parsing logic
- Implement SJF algorithm
- Test scheduling output for accuracy
