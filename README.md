Process Scheduling Simulation with SRTF and Round Robin Algorithms (Python & Matplotlib)
This Python project simulates two CPU scheduling algorithms—Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) and Round Robin—using real-world Chrome process data from a CSV file. The program reads process data (PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time), computes scheduling metrics, and generates a Gantt Chart visualization and a performance summary table using matplotlib.

Key Features:
CSV Data Handling with pandas

SRTF Algorithm Implementation (preemptive)

Round Robin Algorithm Implementation (with time quantum)

Dynamic Gantt Chart Visualization

Performance Metrics Table:

Completion Time

Turnaround Time

Waiting Time

High Precision Time Steps (e.g., 0.01 units)

Idle Time Handling

Output:
Visual Gantt charts (srtf_gantt_chart.png)

Execution order tracking

Process performance comparison

This project provides a clear understanding of CPU scheduling behavior and is useful for educational purposes or system-level simulations.
